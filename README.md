![Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-Academic-green.svg)

**PyMoney** is a command-line personal finance management application developed as an academic project in Python. This application demonstrates fundamental programming concepts including data structures, file handling, and command-line interface design.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Command-line Interface**: Demonstrates text-based user interaction
- **Transaction Management**: Add, view, and delete financial transactions
- **Category System**: Hierarchical category structure for expense organization
- **Search Functionality**: Filter transactions by category
- **Data Persistence**: File I/O operations for saving and loading data
- **Error Handling**: Input validation with user feedback

## ðŸ“¥ How to Run

1. Download the script from:
   ```
   https://github.com/chs415009/Pymoney/blob/main/Pymoney.py
   ```
2. Run in any Python environment (version 3.6 or higher)
   ```
   python Pymoney.py
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage Guide

### First-time Setup
When launching PyMoney for the first time, you'll be prompted to enter your initial balance:

```
How much money do you have? 1000
```

If you enter an invalid value, the system will default to 0.

### Available Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `add` | Add new transaction(s) | `add 2020-01-01 breakfast -50` |
| `view` | Display all transactions | `view` |
| `view categories` | Show category hierarchy | `view categories` |
| `delete` | Remove a transaction | `delete 3` |
| `find` | Search by category | `find food` |
| `exit` | Save and quit application | `exit` |

## ðŸ“– Detailed Usage Instructions

### Category Management
PyMoney uses a hierarchical category system to help organize your finances. View the built-in categories:

```
> view categories
```

### Adding Transactions
Add transactions using the following format:
```
add [date] [description] [amount]
```

For example:
```
> add 2023-05-10 lunch -120
```

Add multiple transactions at once:
```
> add 2023-05-10 lunch -120 2023-05-10 transportation -30
```

### Viewing Transactions
Display all recorded transactions and current balance:
```
> view
```

![View Transactions Example](./readme%20pics/6%20view.png)

### Deleting Transactions
Remove a transaction by referencing its index number:
```
> delete 2
```

The index numbers are displayed when using the `view` command.

### Finding Transactions
Search for transactions by category:
```
> find food
```

This will display all transactions under the specified category, including its subcategories.

### Exiting the Application
To save your changes and exit:
```
> exit
```

**Important**: Changes are only saved when exiting through this command.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **Data Structures**: Uses lists and dictionaries to organize financial data
- **File I/O**: Implements text file reading/writing for data persistence
